        <p>
          The National Service Scheme (NSS) is a youth volunteer program run by the Government of India. It was established in 1969 with the aim of inculcating the spirit of national service among the youth. The NSS has over 3 million volunteers enrolled in over 300,000 units across India.</p>

        <p>
          The NSS units are numbered sequentially, starting with unit 1 at the University of Delhi. The units are typically affiliated to colleges and universities, but there are also NSS units affiliated to schools, government departments, and other organizations.
        </p> 
          The NSS units organize a variety of community service activities, such as health camps, blood donation drives, tree planting drives, and disaster relief work. The NSS also organizes educational and cultural activities, such as workshops, seminars, and competitions.
        <p>   
          The NSS is a valuable program that helps to develop the character and leadership skills of young people. It also helps to promote social awareness and civic responsibility. If you are interested in joining the NSS, you can contact your nearest NSS unit.
